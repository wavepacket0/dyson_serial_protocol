# Dyson V10+ Serial Protocol
This repo contains information about the serial protocol (V10+) used by Dyson cleaners for communication between the battery BMS and the cleaner.

The [Home](https://github.com/wavepacket0/dyson_serial_protocol/wiki/1.-Home) wiki page is the start.

Planned releases [ongoing!]:
- Python frame parser
  - research / test environment
- C library implementing communication state machine
  - to be used in battery firmware
 
The goal is to provide a small C library implementing the communication protocol, to be used in V10+ battery firmwares.
